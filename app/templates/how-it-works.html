            <h1>How does it work?</h1>

            <p class="help-block">PeepWeather's algorithm for deciding each hour's color is as follows.</p>

            <h3>Overall operation</h3>

            <p>When you enter a location, PeepWeather converts it to a latitude and longitude (if it's a zip code, using
                a data file of U.S. towns) then passes that to a query of the U.S. Government's
                <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ndfd/">National Digital Forecast Database</a> 
                <a href="http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/rest.php">REST Web Service</a>. It parses the resulting file
                to find hourly data, filling in gaps for missing hours. (Different parameters are sampled at different
                rates, e.g., every three hours for some and every 12 hours for others.) Finally it builds a hourly
                calendar-like HTML table for display, coloring in each hour using the below algorithm.
            </p>

            <h3>Color calculation details</h3>

            <p>Each hour's color is chosen in three steps: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, each weather parameter (percent of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed - but
                    <strong>not</strong> cloud cover) is assessed individually to get one of three desirability ratings
                    - <code>Low</code>, <code>Medium</code>, and <code>High</code> - based on a simple formula.
                </li>
                <li>Second, those three ratings are combined to get one of four overall desirability ratings for the
                    hour - <code>Poor</code>, <code>Fair</code>, <code>Okay</code>, and <code>Great</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, the overall desirability rating is mapped to a color, such as: <code>Great</code> = green,
                    <code>Okay</code> = yellow, <code>Fair</code> = Orange, and <code>Poor</code> = red.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                This means there are two types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29">functions</a>
                involved: One to convert each of the three parameter values into a Low, Medium, and High rating, and a
                second one to combine these into a Poor, Fair, Okay, and Great hour rating. Let's call these the
                <code>Parameter Function</code> and the <code>Hourly Function</code>.</p>


            <h3>Parameter Function</h3>
            On this site, the Parameter Function breaks the parameter (percent of precipitation, temperature, wind
            speed, or cloud cover) into ranges that determine the rating. An example might be that if wind is between 0 MPH and 5 MPH
            then consider that desirability High. If it is between 6 MPH and 10 MPH consider it Medium desirable, and if it's higher
            than 10 MPH then its desirability is Low. Percent of precipitation would work similarly, for example: 0% to 10% might be
            High desirability, 10% to 20% Medium, and Low for anything higher than 20%. Both of these are essentially three
            step ranges, graphically shown as:

            <div class="row">
<pre class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-1">
H +--+
  |  |
M |  +---+
  |      |
L +      +--->

  0  v1  v2
</pre>
            </div>

            This makes clear that all it takes is two parameter values (called v1 and v2 above) to identify the range.
            When viewed from left to right, v1 is the High-to-Medium transition, and v2 is the Medium-to-Low transition. In the wind
            example, v1 = 5 MPH and v2 = 10 MPH. The precipitation example had 10% and 20% for v1 and v2, respectively.
            In other words, these two numbers identify the 'breaks' where the steps go down from left to right. We call
            this first type of Parameter Function a "H-M-L" step.

            But what about temperature? Well, temperature is different because it has a low range too - it can't be too
            cold OR too warm, but between those two Low-desirability extremes there are Medium and High values. Our Parameter
            Function for temperature has this shape:

            <div class="row">
<pre class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-1">
H         +---+
          |   |
M     +---+   +---+
      |           |
L <- -+           +--->

      v1  v2  v3  v4
</pre>
            </div>

            We call this Parameter Function a "L-M-H-M-L" hat, and it is characterized by four values, from left to
            right: v1 (the L-to-M transition), v2 (Medium-to-High), v3 (High-to-Medium), and v4 (Medium-to-Low). For example,
            the four values 32, 40, 70, and 85 (all °F) say that anything colder than 32°F or warmer than 85°F are
            considered Low desirability, Medium is between 32 and 40, and between 70 and 85, and the 40 to 70 sweet spot is High
            desirability. Simple!

            That describes the two kinds of Parameter Functions. Now let's look at how those are combined by the Hourly Function.


            <h3>Hourly Function</h3>
            For each hour, once the program uses the Parameter Functions to get Low, Medium, and High values for the
            three weather parameters, it runs them through an Hourly Function to get the Poor, Fair, Okay, or Great hour rating.
            Currently this is determined by non-editable rules:

            <ul>
                <li>If any of the three parameters is Low, then the hour is considered Poor.</li>
                <li>If all are High then the hour is Great.</li>
                <li>If there are two High ratings and one Medium then the hour is Okay.</li>
                <li>Otherwise (one High and two Medium) then the hour is Fair.</li>
            </ul>

            The weather parameters are treated equally and are not weighted in any way.
