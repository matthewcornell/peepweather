    <h2>Welcome to the RC Weather App!</h2>

    <p>
        This is a proof-of-concept app that gives an "at a glance" view of the next seven days from the
        perspective of an outdoor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_aircraft">radio control
        aircraft</a> enthusiast.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because the weather is a major factor, I thought showing a simple color-coded hourly
        forecast would be useful. The table on this page has columns representing days of the week and has rows for
        hours of the day. Each cell is an hour whose color is determined by a simple algorithm that takes into account
        three forecast parameters: probability of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. The <em>Color ey</em>
        table below shows details. The forecast data is currently US-only because it comes from the National Digital
        Forecast Database (NDFD)
        <a href="http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/rest.php">REST Web Service</a>.
