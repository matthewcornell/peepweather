### Introduction

This is a simple web app to display outside weather conditions in an 'at a glance' format where each hour is a cell
that is 'stoplight' color coded based on how good it appears for activities like RC flying.

- index:
    - forms for entering zip, and for entering query

- overall summary
- geolocation!
- change Hour.color() to give numerical rating to each variable, then sum to get final. any red would have to override
  result, though
- make pretty :-)
